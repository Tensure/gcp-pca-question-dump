Using the Standard storage class for the initial two-week period allows for immediate access and processing of the CCTV footage videos when they are actively being analyzed for potential threats. After this initial processing period, you can leverage lifecycle rules to automatically transition the videos to the Coldline storage class. Coldline storage is designed for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data and offers lower storage costs compared to Standard storage, helping to minimize costs for storing the videos.</p><p><br></p><p>You should use Standard storage class for the first two weeks, and use lifecycle rules to transition to Nearline. -&gt;&nbsp;Incorrect. While using the Standard storage class for the initial two weeks is a good approach for immediate access and processing, transitioning the videos to the Nearline storage class may not be the most cost-effective option. Nearline storage is designed for data that is accessed less frequently than Standard storage but more frequently than Coldline storage. Since the scenario mentions that the footage undergoes consistent processing, it suggests that the videos might not be frequently accessed after the initial two-week period, making Coldline a more suitable and cost-effective option.</p><p><br></p><p>You should use Standard storage class for the first two weeks, and then move videos to Persistent Disk. -&gt;&nbsp;Incorrect.

While transitioning to Coldline storage using lifecycle rules is a recommended approach, using the Standard storage class for the first 30 days may not be necessary if the processing period mentioned in the scenario is only two weeks. By using Standard storage for the entire 30 days, you would incur higher storage costs compared to using it for just the initial two weeks.

Cloud Shell is a web-based command-line tool provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for managing resources and interacting with various services. When you work within Cloud Shell, you have a persistent home directory (represented by the tilde \"~\"), which is associated with your user account. By placing the file in the <code>~/bin</code> directory, you ensure that it is within the default execution path. This directory is typically included in the default execution path for user accounts in Linux-based systems. When you install a utility in this directory, it becomes accessible from anywhere within the command-line environment without specifying the full path to the utility. Additionally, the file will remain persistent across multiple sessions because the home directory is associated with your user account and persists between Cloud Shell sessions. This means that the file will be available even if you close and reopen Cloud Shell or switch to a different GCP project.</p><p><br></p><p>In a Cloud Storage bucket -&gt;&nbsp;Incorrect.
